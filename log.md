##------------# 100 Days Of Code - Log #------------##


### --- Day 1: Sunday 18th March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed the basics of FreeCodeCamp Front End Certification and completed the Tribute Page of the beginners projects. - 8 hours of study and web development.

**Thoughts** I've been studying Web development for approximately 6 months and up until this point have not really been doing the right things to progress as quickly as I could be. I decided to do FCC based off a suggestion YouTuber Dylan Israel made in one of his videos. Even though the begginer stuff is below my capability I feel I need to consolidate my knowledge from the ground up. So here I am!

### --- Day 2: Monday 19th March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Started the FreeCodeCamp Portfolio Page project. Spent time on the wireframing and design aspect of the page. Researched BootStrap Navbars and other technologies like a carousel for the example pages. Made sure I was satisfying the user stories in my design. - 8 hours of coding.

**Thoughts:** Starting a project is dauntring when you have little experience. Knowing where and what to start has been a major area for personal developement on my behalf. I feel this project is one I have a good idea on what I want to have and therefore felt instantaneous progress.

### --- Day 3: Tuesday 20th March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the Portfolio Page. - 8 hours of coding.

**Thoughts**: Put in the structure of the website (Navbar, Jumbotron, Divs and backgrouds) Also completed the content of the page including searching for images for the icons on the page. Also researched scrolling images code to add a carousel feature on the page of my previous work(This took some time).

### --- Day 4 Wednesday 21st March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed the first draft of my portfolio page. - 10 hours of coding.

**Thoughts**: Put the final touches of the pages functionality together, i.e the clickable social media links, tested the functionality and made sure the right CSS was applied for the various screen sizes. The absolute and relative positioning feature introduced through the CSS of the carsousel was a massive learning curve and where I spent the majority of my time.

### --- Day 5 Thursday 22nd March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Started the Basic JavasScript section of FreeCodeCamp, almost through the entire 10hours in one day. - 6 hours of study.

**Thoughts**: A lot of stuff I had done previously but a few new concepts and a few that needed cementing into the memory bank. Starting to get to a point in the course content that is challenging and where I am learning again.

### --- Day 6 Friday 23rd March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic of JavasScript section of FreeCodeCamp. - 2 hours of study.

**Thoughts**: Into content that is a bit hazey so really starting to enjoy this course and putting in a lot of research outside of the course to make sure I fully understand the content. i.e MDN.com

### --- Day 7 Saturday 24th March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Started and completed the Object Oriented and Functional Programming section of FreeCodeCamp and started on Algorithms! - 8 hours of study.

**Thoughts**: Objects section was familiar and the usual learning and filling gaps on more programming skills. The Algorithms was the part I was looking forward to and the expected 50 hours was something I wanted to beat without cheating. The first two took me over 5 hours so I think I am going to struggle however this is what I was looking for as I learn best under doing rather than listening.

### --- Day 8 Sunday 25th March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Slack day! - 1 hours of watching material.

**Thoughts**: Had a busy day with family and only had time to meet my obligation watching videos and reading material. (Medium and Dylan Israel-360 tutorials)

### --- Day 9 Monday 26th March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Worked on 2 algorithms (Factorialize a Number & Check for Palindromes Complete. - 6 hours of study.

**Thoughts**: Having to do a lot of background research to understand fully all the methods and options to carry out the Algorithm. Enjoying the learning feeling!

### --- Day 10 Tuesday 27th March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Worked on 3 algorithms (Find the Longest Word in a String, Title Case a Sentence and Return Largest Numbers in Arrays) - 7 hours of study.

**Thoughts**: Was very excited to complete the Return the largest number task as I completed it without any influence. Feeling good progress. FCC is awesome!

### --- Day 11 Wednesday 28th March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed three algorithms (Confirm the Ending, Repeat a string repeat a string and Truncate a string) - 7 hours of study.

**Thoughts**: Today was a tough one, I spent a lot of time on these Algos. The substr() command was a new thing for me so spent the bulk of the time researching this aspect and the Truncate task took a lot of research also!

### --- Day 12 Thursday 29th March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed just one algorithm today two algorithms (Chunky Monkey ) - 3 hours of study.

**Thoughts**: These Algorithms have been tough and had to get up early due to a medical appiontment, took my surfboard to get some early mornging surf but the waves were huge. Biggest I have ever seen so I took the entire morning off driving the coast to find the best waves. Chunky was a challenging Algo and I spent a lot of time researching how to complet it in the afternoon.

### --- Day 13 Friday 30th March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: After yesterdays sidetrack I completed 3 algorithms and was stuck on a fourth for 3 hours. Completed (Slasher Flick, Mutations and Falsy Bouncer) - 10 hours of study.

**Thoughts**: Couple of easier ones to start then Falsy Bouncer I needed to invest a lot of time in researching the result. Got it and started working on the one I have found the hardest so far - Seek and Destroy! Struggling with the Filter(); method!

### --- Day 14 Saturday 31st March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed 2 Algorithms (Seek and Destroy and Where Do I Belong?) - 5 hours of study

**Thoughts**: Seek and Destroy! Finally got that Ahaaa moment with the Filter(); method! I did end up cheating by checking the spolier code however I was happy that all I needed to do was change one line of code on my solution to solve the problem, which was the part that gave me the Ahaa moment. Also completed "Where do I belong" after a small amount of research. Started on the final Algorithm before moving onto JSON tomorrow.

### --- Day 15 Sunday 1st April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed the final algorithm of the basic algo's and the JSON, API's & Ajax lessons. (Caesars Cipher) - 5 hoursâ€‰

**Thoughts**: The Cipher challenge was a step up in difficulty, however I made good progress on it. I had to peek at the way to switch the numbers but had a good do at it at first. My code was almost identical to the solutions once I finished. However I got stuck for a longer than necessary period because I had && instead of || in my if statement!!!!! Worked that out myself and that felt good.

### --- Day 16 Monday 2nd April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the Quotes challenge from FreeCodeCamp. Built the welcome page and started research on the logic and web design. - 10 hours of web development and research.

**Thoughts**: Spent far too long on the HTML and CSS, something that I should be doing last anyway. I learnt about prioritisation of work if nothing else on this frustrating day. Working on getting a key from the API site as it doesn't seem to be striaght forward on how to get that generated. Also I want to build a guessing interaction into the project to make it a little more interactive.
