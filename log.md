2. [GitHub - JavaScript Prmodoro Clock](https://github.com/Rubick-dev/promodoroclock)


### --- Day 53 Wednesday 9th May, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Complete the logic of the Pomodoro Clock, spent the entire day on it. - 10 hours of coding. 
 
**Thoughts**: This was a real brain twister, im sure my code is excessive but in the end, it does what i need it to do in terms of functionality. Steps for tomorrow are to pretty it up with some CSS and its done and onto the second last challenge! Super happy to get this aspect of the project done today as it was one of those confidence checkers. I used nested loops, switch statements, conditionals. eventListeners and functions within functions and even a ternary operator again. I think I have nailed those now.

### --- Day 52 Tuesday 8th May, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the logic aspect of the Prmodoro Clock. 8 hours of coding
 
**Thoughts**: Mix of structure changes, added bootstrap, added the click events and researched more on the timer. This one is going to make me dig deep as its something i have not seen before in any of the lessons I have done.

### --- Day 51 Monday 7th May, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Started work on the Promodoro Clock. - 6 hours of coding.
 
**Thoughts**: Got most of the structure and skeleton in place today and did a fair bit of research into setInterval and how that works. More research tomorrow though.

### --- Day 50 Sunday 6th May, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed the JavaScript Calculator and updated my portfolio to include the new JSCalc app. - 8 hours of study.
 
**Thoughts**: Completed the calculator, did some vigorous testing and it all came up nicely. This was my first project that really had me thinking a lot about structure and gettign a system in place to make sure im not missing anything. Larger projects would make for much more complex challenges and going off a memory wouldnt work to well.

### --- Day 46 Wednesday 2nd May, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed the remaining advanced challenges on FreeCodeCamp. 10 hours of study and research.
 
**Thoughts**: Had to do a fair bit of spoiler filled research to make sure I was on the right track as I didnt understand what was being asked of me. I understand why this is being asked as it is real world scenarios potentially or when in a role you will get minimal info and need to work with it.

1. [Advanced Algorithm Scripting - Inventory-Update](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/inventory-update)


### --- Day 44 Monday 30th April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed two FreeCodeCamp Advanced Algorithms - 6 hours of research and study.
 
**Thoughts**: Challenging content that could haven taken me days to resolve. Spent a lot of time researching reduce to understand how it exactly works. Didnt realise that it would iterate over multiple arrays and compare the returned array with the next until they are all done. Once that was understood I got through the two challenges fairly quickly with some confirming of my ideas.

### --- Day 41 Friday 27th April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Scrimba course on CSS Grid and then the final touches of converting my TwitchTV application from Bootstrap to the CSS Grid. - Completed 7 hours of study and coding.
 
**Thoughts**: CSS Grid is a game changer for layouts, so easy to do wireframes also. I easily solved problems with layout I was having and this makes the front end even more intuitive and easily updated. This also solved my problem with the page breaking on refresh.

### --- Day 38 Tuesday 24th April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Big day today as I got through 5 Intermediate Algorithym challenges. 7 hours of study.
 
**Thoughts**: Rreally enjoyed the pig latin, used minimal research to get the solution. With the DNA pairing I thought a Switch would be the best option and when i checked the hints it guided me that way and I ended up completing the project without any research or solution checking. What a forfilling day where I gained a lot of confidence due to some great solutions gained through a mix of my knowledge and research.

**Today's Progress**: Short day of study today as spent some time with the GF. Moved onto the Intermediate Algorythms - 3 hours of study.
 
**Thoughts**: Finally past the intermediate Web Dev challenges and onto Intrermediate Algorithms. Found the one I was on quiet difficult, I had to do a lot of research to get parts of it done. In the end a quick comparison check of a solution and mine were almost identical and I just needed to make a few changes to get it working.

### --- Day 34 Friday 20th April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Twitch API project trying various things to get the data out of twitch. Had another Job interview however it was a recruitment role. - Just 2 hours today
 
**Thoughts**: Need to find a mentor to bounce ideas off and get some guidance when i get stuck like this. It is taking too much time to solve problems due to this lack of support. I have decided to spend more time looking for someone to help me with coding.

### --- Day 32 Wednesday 18th April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Prepared for then attended the afternoon Web Developer interview for a local Software companmy. -4 hours of study on regular CSS, HTML and JS interview questions.

**Thoughts**: I assumed that the interviewers had reviewed my protfolio of work here on github and then decided to interview me. I really thought I had a chance of securing the job after only calling up to see if i could get some mentorship or even a bit of experience working on some easier projects or bug fixing. Unfortunately as an ex recruiter of 9 years I could tell the interviwer had made up his mind at first sight of me. You see I am a little bit older than your average junior developer and I there were indications that he was a little ageist. He also mentioned that he only briefly checked over my proftfolio and had no idea about my capability level. I really felt in an unusual position of being judged negatively due to my experience and age, l also felt belittled. This resulted in a level of pressure that I am not used to in interviews as an experiecned recruiter most interviews result in offers for me. This ultimately led to my mistakes throughout the interview where I screwed up hard with some even emberassing things that I said. I only blame myself as I let someone else influence my performance and I am in control of my actions. I have learnt a lot from this experience and  from my mistakes. These wont happen next time and I suer as hell wont let people like this effect the end goal of transfering my career into the wonderful world of coding.

### --- Day 31 Tuesday 17th April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the logic for the twitchTV API, focusing on getting the information displayed on the screen. I also applied for my first Web dev role. - 5 hours of coding.
 
**Thoughts**: Spent the morning trying to work out how to display information returned into an object and how to iterate over it and get it displayed on the screen as per user story requirements. Without anyone to bounce ideas off it is taking a lot of time. The company I applied for called back after reviewing my portfolio and asked me to come into an interview the following day. Excited to have my first Job Interview as a web developer.

### --- Day 30 Monday 16th April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Produced a API key and started to build out the API ajax code. Discovered where to get each piece of information required to complete the user stories. Did a wireframe design of the page. Started to work out the logic for displaying the information. uploaded the first draft of the project to github. - 10 hours of research and coding.
 
**Thoughts**: Found this one the most challenging project to date. Due to the helix API being relatively new there was very little resources of information about it. Eventually tracked down everything I needed and am able to display the data i need.

### --- Day 29 Sunday 15th April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Started the research into building the TwitchTV API project. The API that FreeCodeCamp has asked me to use will be depricated by the end of the year so I have taken the challenge to use the new Helix API. Spent the entire day researching how to interact with it. - 6 hours of research.
 
**Thoughts**: The new API does not send back the same data as the oriignal and therfore has made the project a lot more complex than the intermediate project requested. There needs to be two Ajax calls and you must use a key in the header.

### --- Day 28 Saturday 14th April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Finished off the media query for mobile and uploaded the final version of the wiki search tool to heroku. Also updarted the portfolio carousel to include the page as an example. - 5 hours of coding.
 
**Thoughts**: Just a lot of tidying up and also reviewed the next development challenge.

### --- Day 27 Friday 13th April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed the final draft of fullscreen version, including a lot of CSS. - 6 hours of coding and research.
 
**Thoughts**: Spent a lot of time on positioning the pages on full screen version as well as the buttons. I wanted to do something less generic as i usually work on Bootstrap buttons. Really enjoyed learning about differnet effects.

### --- Day 26 Thursday 12th April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Started coding the logic and skeleton of the Wiki search challenge. - 7 hours of coding
 
**Thoughts**: Got stuck on CORS details and definitely need to go back over that to understand more. REally happy with the progreess overall though and now have the data returning in an object so just need to display it on the page and do some testing / fine tuning. Goal is to be finsihed tomorrow.

### --- Day 24 Tuesday 10th April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Current Wheather API and Geo Location linked website and added it to my portfolio. - 6 hours of coding
 
**Thoughts**: Goal hit success and the app is tested and working as intended. Really today was about getting the toggle to work and that was simple with a few global variables and the Celsius to Fahrenheit math algorithm. Also prettied it up with some CSS. Onto the next challenge tomorrow.

### --- Day 23 Monday 9th April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Focused on the Ajax call and the logic to manipulate the DOM with the API data for the current location weather conditions. - 4 hours of coding.
 
**Thoughts**: It feels like all the pieces to the puzzle are coming together on this project, took a while to work out all the moving parts. Now its just down to making it look pretty and putting the right information into the page from the API call. Goal is to be finished the website completely by tomorrow ans starting the next project.

### --- Day 22 Sunday 8th April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Focused on the JavaScript and logic of the application. Started on the Navigator.geolocation side of things. 3 hours of development and research.

**Thoughts**: Got stuck on the navigator side of things, something new which I havent done before. Slowing my progress right down unfortuantely. Got it working in the end.

### --- Day 21 Saturday 7th April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the Weather API application from FCC Int challenges. - 2 hours of research

**Thoughts**: Designed the content of the page and wire framed the solution. Researched the API's available. Created the boiler plates of the files I will need in the application. Still not 100% with linking to API's so spent a big chunk of time reviewing the JSON, API and AJAX module of FCC.

### --- Day 20 Friday 6th April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed the FreeCodeCamp Challenge of Quote generator. I turned this project into a guessing game and score keeper. Uploaded it live on heroku. Also added it to the carousel on my Portfolio Page. Also converted a minimal version over to CodePen. - 10 hours of development.

**Thoughts**: I really feel that I have benefited greatly from this challenge and for stepping it above and beyond expected. I have done copious ammounts of research and only needed to copy the ajax code in the end. Everything else is 100% developed from my own knowledge.

### --- Day 19 Thursday 5th April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Huge progress on the web page, lots of research and getting the website to almost functional state. - 12 hours of development and research. 

**Thoughts**: Found the JavaScript on this project fairly straight forward. I still struggle to get HTML to look like I want and therefore a lot of time spent on that aspect. Today I redisgned from a circular asthetic to a square.

### --- Day 18 Wednesday 4th April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the project however was a short day due to 3 doctors appointments of my partner!! - 3 hours of development and research.

**Thoughts**: Set the wireframe in place and finalesed my own user stories. Decided to go away from jQuery accept for the ajax and one element selector. Massively I decided to turn the project from a simple quote generator to a guessing game that kept score.

### --- Day 17 Tuesday 3rd April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Connected my quotes app through Ajax and got the data stored in variables. - 5 hours 

**Thoughts**: Ajax and jQuery are fairly new to me so it was challenging to get my head around all the parts I needed to understand to build the core backend processing of it. I made significant progress after about 3 hours of research and about 2 hours of coding. Just need to tiudy it uo pa bit now from a presentation point of view and add a bit of the extra functionality which will turn it into a game.

### --- Day 16 Monday 2nd April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the Quotes challenge from FreeCodeCamp. Built the welcome page and started research on the logic and web design. - 10 hours of web development and research.

**Thoughts**: Spent far too long on the HTML and CSS, something that I should be doing last anyway. I learnt about prioritisation of work if nothing else on this frustrating day. Working on getting a key from the API site as it doesn't seem to be striaght forward on how to get that generated. Also I want to build a guessing interaction into the project to make it a little more interactive.

### --- Day 15 Sunday 1st April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed the final algorithm of the basic algo's and the JSON, API's & Ajax lessons. (Caesars Cipher) - 5 hours of study 

**Thoughts**: The Cipher challenge was a step up in difficulty, however I made good progress on it. I had to peek at the way to switch the numbers but had a good do at it at first. My code was almost identical to the solutions once I finished. However I got stuck for a longer than necessary period because I had && instead of || in my if statement!!!!! Worked that out myself and that felt good.

### --- Day 14 Saturday 31st March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed 2 Algorithms (Seek and Destroy and Where Do I Belong?) - 5 hours of study

**Thoughts**: Seek and Destroy! Finally got that Ahaaa moment with the Filter(); method! I did end up cheating by checking the spolier code however I was happy that all I needed to do was change one line of code on my solution to solve the problem, which was the part that gave me the Ahaa moment. Also completed "Where do I belong" after a small amount of research. Started on the final Algorithm before moving onto JSON tomorrow.

### --- Day 13 Friday 30th March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: After yesterdays sidetrack I completed 3 algorithms and was stuck on a fourth for 3 hours. Completed (Slasher Flick, Mutations and Falsy Bouncer) - 10 hours of study.

**Thoughts**: Couple of easier ones to start then Falsy Bouncer I needed to invest a lot of time in researching the result. Got it and started working on the one I have found the hardest so far - Seek and Destroy! Struggling with the Filter(); method!

### --- Day 12 Thursday 29th March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed just one algorithm today two algorithms (Chunky Monkey ) - 3 hours of study.

**Thoughts**: These Algorithms have been tough and had to get up early due to a medical appiontment, took my surfboard to get some early mornging surf but the waves were huge. Biggest I have ever seen so I took the entire morning off driving the coast to find the best waves. Chunky was a challenging Algo and I spent a lot of time researching how to complet it in the afternoon.

### --- Day 11 Wednesday 28th March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed three algorithms (Confirm the Ending, Repeat a string repeat a string and Truncate a string) - 7 hours of study.

**Thoughts**: Today was a tough one, I spent a lot of time on these Algos. The substr() command was a new thing for me so spent the bulk of the time researching this aspect and the Truncate task took a lot of research also!

### --- Day 8 Sunday 25th March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Slack day! - 1 hours of watching material.

**Thoughts**: Had a busy day with family and only had time to meet my obligation watching videos and reading material. (Medium and Dylan Israel-360 tutorials)

### --- Day 7 Saturday 24th March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Started and completed the Object Oriented and Functional Programming section of FreeCodeCamp and started on Algorithms! - 8 hours of study.

**Thoughts**: Objects section was familiar and the usual learning and filling gaps on more programming skills. The Algorithms was the part I was looking forward to and the expected 50 hours was something I wanted to beat without cheating. The first two took me over 5 hours so I think I am going to struggle however this is what I was looking for as I learn best under doing rather than listening.

### --- Day 6 Friday 23rd March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic of JavasScript section of FreeCodeCamp. - 2 hours of study.

**Thoughts**: Into content that is a bit hazey so really starting to enjoy this course and putting in a lot of research outside of the course to make sure I fully understand the content. i.e MDN.com

### --- Day 5 Thursday 22nd March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Started the Basic JavasScript section of FreeCodeCamp, almost through the entire 10hours in one day. - 6 hours of study.

**Thoughts**: A lot of stuff I had done previously but a few new concepts and a few that needed cementing into the memory bank. Starting to get to a point in the course content that is challenging and where I am learning again.

### --- Day 4 Wednesday 21st March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed the first draft of my portfolio page. - 10 hours of coding.

**Thoughts**: Put the final touches of the pages functionality together, i.e the clickable social media links, tested the functionality and made sure the right CSS was applied for the various screen sizes. The absolute and relative positioning feature introduced through the CSS of the carsousel was a massive learning curve and where I spent the majority of my time.

### --- Day 3: Tuesday 20th March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the Portfolio Page. - 8 hours of coding.

**Thoughts**: Put in the structure of the website (Navbar, Jumbotron, Divs and backgrouds) Also completed the content of the page including searching for images for the icons on the page. Also researched scrolling images code to add a carousel feature on the page of my previous work(This took some time).

### --- Day 2: Monday 19th March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Started the FreeCodeCamp Portfolio Page project. Spent time on the wireframing and design aspect of the page. Researched BootStrap Navbars and other technologies like a carousel for the example pages. Made sure I was satisfying the user stories in my design. - 8 hours of coding.

**Thoughts:** Starting a project is dauntring when you have little experience. Knowing where and what to start has been a major area for personal developement on my behalf. I feel this project is one I have a good idea on what I want to have and therefore felt instantaneous progress.

### --- Day 1: Sunday 18th March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed the basics of FreeCodeCamp Front End Certification and completed the Tribute Page of the beginners projects. - 8 hours of study and web development.

**Thoughts** I've been studying Web development for approximately 6 months and up until this point have not really been doing the right things to progress as quickly as I could be. I decided to do FCC based off a suggestion YouTuber Dylan Israel made in one of his videos. Even though the begginer stuff is below my capability I feel I need to consolidate my knowledge from the ground up. So here I am!
