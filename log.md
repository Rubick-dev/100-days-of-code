############# START OF DEV DIARY #############

### --- Day 24 Tuesday 10th April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Current Wheather API and Geo Location linked website and added it to my portfolio. - 6 hours of coding
 
**Thoughts**: Goal hit success and the app is tested and working as intended. Really today was about getting the toggle to work and that was simple with a few global variables and the Celsius to Fahrenheit math algorithm. Also prettied it up with some CSS. Onto the next challenge tomorrow.

### --- Day 23 Monday 9th April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Focused on the Ajax call and the logic to manipulate the DOM with the API data for the current location weather conditions. - 4 hours of coding.
 
**Thoughts**: It feels like all the pieces to the puzzle are coming together on this project, took a while to work out all the moving parts. Now its just down to making it look pretty and putting the right information into the page from the API call. Goal is to be finished the website completely by tomorrow ans starting the next project.

### --- Day 22 Sunday 8th April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Focused on the JavaScript and logic of the application. Started on the Navigator.geolocation side of things. 3 hours of development and research.

**Thoughts**: Got stuck on the navigator side of things, something new which I havent done before. Slowing my progress right down unfortuantely. Got it working in the end.

### --- Day 21 Saturday 7th April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the Weather API application from FCC Int challenges. - 2 hours of research

**Thoughts**: Designed the content of the page and wire framed the solution. Researched the API's available. Created the boiler plates of the files I will need in the application. Still not 100% with linking to API's so spent a big chunk of time reviewing the JSON, API and AJAX module of FCC.

### --- Day 20 Friday 6th April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed the FreeCodeCamp Challenge of Quote generator. I turned this project into a guessing game and score keeper. Uploaded it live on heroku. Also added it to the carousel on my Portfolio Page. Also converted a minimal version over to CodePen. - 10 hours of development.

**Thoughts**: I really feel that I have benefited greatly from this challenge and for stepping it above and beyond expected. I have done copious ammounts of research and only needed to copy the ajax code in the end. Everything else is 100% developed from my own knowledge.

### --- Day 19 Thursday 5th April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Huge progress on the web page, lots of research and getting the website to almost functional state. - 12 hours of development and research. 

**Thoughts**: Found the JavaScript on this project fairly straight forward. I still struggle to get HTML to look like I want and therefore a lot of time spent on that aspect. Today I redisgned from a circular asthetic to a square.

### --- Day 18 Wednesday 4th April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the project however was a short day due to 3 doctors appointments of my partner!! - 3 hours of development and research.

**Thoughts**: Set the wireframe in place and finalesed my own user stories. Decided to go away from jQuery accept for the ajax and one element selector. Massively I decided to turn the project from a simple quote generator to a guessing game that kept score.

### --- Day 17 Tuesday 3rd April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Connected my quotes app through Ajax and got the data stored in variables. - 5 hours 

**Thoughts**: Ajax and jQuery are fairly new to me so it was challenging to get my head around all the parts I needed to understand to build the core backend processing of it. I made significant progress after about 3 hours of research and about 2 hours of coding. Just need to tiudy it uo pa bit now from a presentation point of view and add a bit of the extra functionality which will turn it into a game.

### --- Day 16 Monday 2nd April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the Quotes challenge from FreeCodeCamp. Built the welcome page and started research on the logic and web design. - 10 hours of web development and research.

**Thoughts**: Spent far too long on the HTML and CSS, something that I should be doing last anyway. I learnt about prioritisation of work if nothing else on this frustrating day. Working on getting a key from the API site as it doesn't seem to be striaght forward on how to get that generated. Also I want to build a guessing interaction into the project to make it a little more interactive.

### --- Day 15 Sunday 1st April, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed the final algorithm of the basic algo's and the JSON, API's & Ajax lessons. (Caesars Cipher) - 5 hours of studyâ€‰

**Thoughts**: The Cipher challenge was a step up in difficulty, however I made good progress on it. I had to peek at the way to switch the numbers but had a good do at it at first. My code was almost identical to the solutions once I finished. However I got stuck for a longer than necessary period because I had && instead of || in my if statement!!!!! Worked that out myself and that felt good.

### --- Day 14 Saturday 31st March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed 2 Algorithms (Seek and Destroy and Where Do I Belong?) - 5 hours of study

**Thoughts**: Seek and Destroy! Finally got that Ahaaa moment with the Filter(); method! I did end up cheating by checking the spolier code however I was happy that all I needed to do was change one line of code on my solution to solve the problem, which was the part that gave me the Ahaa moment. Also completed "Where do I belong" after a small amount of research. Started on the final Algorithm before moving onto JSON tomorrow.

### --- Day 13 Friday 30th March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: After yesterdays sidetrack I completed 3 algorithms and was stuck on a fourth for 3 hours. Completed (Slasher Flick, Mutations and Falsy Bouncer) - 10 hours of study.

**Thoughts**: Couple of easier ones to start then Falsy Bouncer I needed to invest a lot of time in researching the result. Got it and started working on the one I have found the hardest so far - Seek and Destroy! Struggling with the Filter(); method!

### --- Day 12 Thursday 29th March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed just one algorithm today two algorithms (Chunky Monkey ) - 3 hours of study.

**Thoughts**: These Algorithms have been tough and had to get up early due to a medical appiontment, took my surfboard to get some early mornging surf but the waves were huge. Biggest I have ever seen so I took the entire morning off driving the coast to find the best waves. Chunky was a challenging Algo and I spent a lot of time researching how to complet it in the afternoon.

### --- Day 11 Wednesday 28th March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed three algorithms (Confirm the Ending, Repeat a string repeat a string and Truncate a string) - 7 hours of study.

**Thoughts**: Today was a tough one, I spent a lot of time on these Algos. The substr() command was a new thing for me so spent the bulk of the time researching this aspect and the Truncate task took a lot of research also!

### --- Day 10 Tuesday 27th March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Worked on 3 algorithms (Find the Longest Word in a String, Title Case a Sentence and Return Largest Numbers in Arrays) - 7 hours of study.

**Thoughts**: Was very excited to complete the Return the largest number task as I completed it without any influence. Feeling good progress. FCC is awesome!

### --- Day 9 Monday 26th March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Worked on 2 algorithms (Factorialize a Number & Check for Palindromes Complete. - 6 hours of study.

**Thoughts**: Having to do a lot of background research to understand fully all the methods and options to carry out the Algorithm. Enjoying the learning feeling!

### --- Day 8 Sunday 25th March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Slack day! - 1 hours of watching material.

**Thoughts**: Had a busy day with family and only had time to meet my obligation watching videos and reading material. (Medium and Dylan Israel-360 tutorials)

### --- Day 7 Saturday 24th March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Started and completed the Object Oriented and Functional Programming section of FreeCodeCamp and started on Algorithms! - 8 hours of study.

**Thoughts**: Objects section was familiar and the usual learning and filling gaps on more programming skills. The Algorithms was the part I was looking forward to and the expected 50 hours was something I wanted to beat without cheating. The first two took me over 5 hours so I think I am going to struggle however this is what I was looking for as I learn best under doing rather than listening.

### --- Day 6 Friday 23rd March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic of JavasScript section of FreeCodeCamp. - 2 hours of study.

**Thoughts**: Into content that is a bit hazey so really starting to enjoy this course and putting in a lot of research outside of the course to make sure I fully understand the content. i.e MDN.com

### --- Day 5 Thursday 22nd March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Started the Basic JavasScript section of FreeCodeCamp, almost through the entire 10hours in one day. - 6 hours of study.

**Thoughts**: A lot of stuff I had done previously but a few new concepts and a few that needed cementing into the memory bank. Starting to get to a point in the course content that is challenging and where I am learning again.

### --- Day 4 Wednesday 21st March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed the first draft of my portfolio page. - 10 hours of coding.

**Thoughts**: Put the final touches of the pages functionality together, i.e the clickable social media links, tested the functionality and made sure the right CSS was applied for the various screen sizes. The absolute and relative positioning feature introduced through the CSS of the carsousel was a massive learning curve and where I spent the majority of my time.

### --- Day 3: Tuesday 20th March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the Portfolio Page. - 8 hours of coding.

**Thoughts**: Put in the structure of the website (Navbar, Jumbotron, Divs and backgrouds) Also completed the content of the page including searching for images for the icons on the page. Also researched scrolling images code to add a carousel feature on the page of my previous work(This took some time).

### --- Day 2: Monday 19th March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Started the FreeCodeCamp Portfolio Page project. Spent time on the wireframing and design aspect of the page. Researched BootStrap Navbars and other technologies like a carousel for the example pages. Made sure I was satisfying the user stories in my design. - 8 hours of coding.

**Thoughts:** Starting a project is dauntring when you have little experience. Knowing where and what to start has been a major area for personal developement on my behalf. I feel this project is one I have a good idea on what I want to have and therefore felt instantaneous progress.

### --- Day 1: Sunday 18th March, 2018 --- ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed the basics of FreeCodeCamp Front End Certification and completed the Tribute Page of the beginners projects. - 8 hours of study and web development.

**Thoughts** I've been studying Web development for approximately 6 months and up until this point have not really been doing the right things to progress as quickly as I could be. I decided to do FCC based off a suggestion YouTuber Dylan Israel made in one of his videos. Even though the begginer stuff is below my capability I feel I need to consolidate my knowledge from the ground up. So here I am!
